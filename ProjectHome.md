A library written in C to access the Wii Remote's abilities.

Currently able to toggle LEDs and rumble, as well as use the IR sensor to control the mouse pointer. Can also map wiimote core buttons to the keyboard.

A video of a gui using the API is here:

If you use any of the code in your project, let me know! I'd love to know how it's used.
